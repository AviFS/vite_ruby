# Migrating to Vite

If you would like to add a note about Sprockets, pull requests are welcome!

## Starting Fresh ‚òÄÔ∏è

When starting a new project, following the [guide] should automatically set up
the basic structure under `app/frontend` where you can place your JavaScript,
styles, and other assets.

## Webpacker üì¶

When migrating from [Webpacker], assuming you were placing your packs in `app/javascript/packs`, it might be convenient to change <kbd>sourceCodeDir</kbd> in your `config/vite.json`.

```json
{
  "all": {
    "sourceCodeDir": "app/javascript",
    ...
```

That way you don't have to move code around, and can proceed to copying your
[entries][entrypoints] in `app/javascript/packs` to `app/javascript/entrypoints`.

::: tip Compatibily Note
Before migrating from [Webpacker], make sure that you are not using any loaders
that don't have a counterpart in [Vite], which uses [Rollup] when bundling for production.
