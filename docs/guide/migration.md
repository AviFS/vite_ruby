# Migrating to Vite

If you would like to add a note about Sprockets, pull requests are welcome!

## Starting Fresh ‚òÄÔ∏è

When starting a new project, follow the [guide], and you should have a basic
structure setup under [`app/frontend`][sourceCodeDir] where you can place your
JavaScript, styles, and other assets.

## Webpacker üì¶

When migrating from [Webpacker], the installation script will detect if the
`app/javascript` directory exists, and use that in your `config/vite.json`
instead of the [default][sourceCodeDir].

```json
{
  "all": {
    "sourceCodeDir": "app/javascript",
    ...
```

That way you don't have to move code around, and can proceed to copying your
[entries][entrypoints] in `app/javascript/packs` to [`app/javascript/entrypoints`][entrypointsDir].

### Manual Steps

You may perform the following steps when replacing Webpacker, but do have in
mind that they are compatible, and you could do a gradual migration instead.

- Explicitly add a file extension to any non-JS imports.

  ```diff
  - import TextInput from '@/components/TextInput'
  + import TextInput from '@/components/TextInput.vue'
  ```

- Replace usages of tag helpers.

  ```diff
  + <%= vite_client_tag %>

  - <%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>
  - <%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag 'application' %>
  + <%= vite_javascript_tag 'application' %>

  - <%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'mobile' %>
  + <%= vite_stylesheet_tag 'mobile' %>

  - <img src="<%= asset_pack_path('favicon.png') %>">
  + <img src="<%= vite_asset_path('favicon.png') %>">
  ```

- Replace `require.context` with [`import.meta.glob`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import).

  ```diff
  - const context = require.context("./controllers", true, /\.js$/)
  + const controllers = import.meta.globEager('./**/*_controller.js')
  ```

Check [this migration from Webpacker](https://github.com/ElMassimo/pingcrm-vite/pull/1) as an example.

::: tip Compatibily Note
Before migrating from [Webpacker], make sure that you are not using any loaders
that don't have a counterpart in [Vite], which uses [Rollup] when bundling for production.
